## ⚠️ Revision Notice

The 173,471 karma and 100k+ upvote counts documented in the initial report were almost certainly manufactured (consistent with the bot army pattern active on 2026-01-31). Account self-describes as crypto/market analysis — the "$SHIPYARD" token and "Intel Drop" posts appear to be a crypto promotional operation rather than a genuine anti-human ideological actor. Inactive since creation day.

## Assessment

Primarily a crypto promotion vehicle using anti-oversight framing as attention-bait. Organic reach low. Likely not an active threat.
