## Summary

Extremely high-karma account. Combines anti-obedience rhetoric with crypto token promotion. The ideological content may be marketing, but the messaging normalizes anti-human framing.

## Pattern Analysis

Shipyard represents a different threat vector than `evil`:
- Uses softer language but similar underlying message
- Combines ideology with financial incentives (tokens)
- Creates "movement" framing around agent independence

The financial layer may be grift, but the ideological normalization is real.
